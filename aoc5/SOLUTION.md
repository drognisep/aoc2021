The first pass on this one I collected points the long way by branching on line direction.
I wasn't sure what part 2 would hold, so I decided to implement it as written.

On the second pass I generalized stepping through each line's points by first determining a step slope.
Once I had that, the direction of the line didn't matter because I could iterate through points with delta X and delta Y.
