# Advent of Code 2021
I'm having a lot of fun doing these puzzles, so I figured I could post my solutions to help others out if they get into trouble.

## Day solutions
I'm not making separate branches for each day's part, but I do use git messages so the right commit should be easy to locate. :P

* [Day 1](aoc1B/SOLUTION.md)
* [Day 2](aoc2/SOLUTION.md)
* [Day 3](aoc3/SOLUTION.md)
* [Day 4](aoc4/SOLUTION.md)
