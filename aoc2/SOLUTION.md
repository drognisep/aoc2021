### VERY tricky instructions!

I had to read through them about 3 times to get all the details.
Eventually I was able to get the right answer and continue on.

I just interpreted each command as it was read on this one.
I could have used goroutines, but it seemed unnecessary in this case since the logic is pretty centralized.
So main just reads in the input data, massages it into a parseable format, and sends it off to the interpreter function.

Nothing crazy.
