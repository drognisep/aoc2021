This one wasn't too bad at all.
It made sense in my head to break this one down into multiple steps, and Go has channels and goroutines that make that easy.

So with that in mind I just broke out grouping and comparing into separate steps in a sort of pipeline.
From there I could focus on one problem at a time, and it made solving them much more manageable.
