This one was kind of tricky because of the way the reader is lead to solve the problem initially.
The situation is one of natural exponential complexity.
However, the trick to this is that the fishes can only be in a few finite states.
So flipping the problem on its head and tracking the smaller set of states related to the sum of fish in that state made the problem much more approachable and broke out of the exponential complexity.

This kind of reminds me of the array of structs => struct of arrays refactoring.
